## 3.0.3

#### Improvements
+ Wrapped all DOM mutations into the ```WORenderer```class
+ Now the ```HelpManager``` is a library. And so was refactored in the ```WebOnionSDK``` file and README.md.
+ All the entities are now *interfaces*, and no more *classes*

#### Bugfixes
+ Fixed ```printKeyValuePairs``` method reduce bug.
